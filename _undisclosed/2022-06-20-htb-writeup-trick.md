title: Trick - Hack The Box
excerpt: "Trick is an easy-rated Linux machine from Hack The Box. For it's rating it feel like this is a true 'try harder'-type of box where you have to enumerate everything thoroughly before moving on. However once you're set on the right path, the path is really straight forward and easy to understand. For me this wasn't the most enjoyable box, almost a bit annoying even, but I learned something in the end nevertheless."

title: OpenSource - Hack The Box
excerpt: "OpenSource is an easy-rated Linux machine from Hack The Box. As the name suggests we're met with an OpenSource project that have over shared, in making them vulnerable to code execution. The path to user is quiet unique and it alone makes this box very enjoyable! As a total git-noob I learned a lot through this box, and I can see why it would be rated as easy if you know your way around git, but for me I would rate this as medium."

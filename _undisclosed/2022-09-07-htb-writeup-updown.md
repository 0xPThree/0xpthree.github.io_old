title: UpDown - Hack The Box
excerpt: "UpDown is a medium-rated Linux machine from Hack The Box. Just as it's name this box has it's Ups and Downs. The path to foothold was very fun and fairly easy solved using python, I took my time to write a script to streamline the attack chain. However once on the box, both privilege escalation vectors from www-data to user, and user to root, was very underwhelming and solved in under 10 minutes total. For me this was an easy medium box, and I did enjoy most of it. I learned a few new things and but mostly deepened my knowledge about PHP."

UpDown is a medium-rated Linux machine from Hack The Box. Just as it's name this box has it's Ups and Downs. The path to foothold was very fun and fairly easy solved using python, I took my time to write a script to streamline the attack chain. However once on the box, both privilege escalation vectors from www-data to user, and user to root, was very underwhelming and solved in under 10 minutes total. For me this was an easy medium box, and I did enjoy most of it. I learned a few new things and but mostly deepened my knowledge about PHP.

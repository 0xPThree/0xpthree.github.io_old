title: Outdated - Hack The Box
excerpt: "Outdated is a medium-rated Windows machine from Hack The Box. With a release containing a massive unintended path (Zerologon), paired with huge stability issues, this box has been one of the least enjoyable in a good while; mainly due to frustration. Each individual step along the way is unique and the concept is cool, but the execution is sadly lacking. Nevertheless I deepened my knowledge of Windows AD structure and gained a new privesc tool that might come in handy for future tests."

Outdated is a medium-rated Windows machine from Hack The Box. With a release containing a massive unintended path (Zerologon), paired with huge stability issues, this box has been one of the least enjoyable in a good while; mainly due to frustration. Each individual step along the way is unique and the concept is cool, but the execution is sadly lacking. Nevertheless I deepened my knowledge of Windows AD structure and gained a new privesc tool that might come in handy for future tests.

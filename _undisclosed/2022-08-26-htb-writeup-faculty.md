title: Faculty - Hack The Box
excerpt: "Faculty is a medium-rated Linux machine from Hack The Box. This is one of the most fun boxes I've done in a while, maybe due to the fact that I never got caught in any rabbit hole. Faculty is straight forward and have quiet simple exploits for both user and root. Even if the path to root was very short, it showcase the importance of Linux capabilities and deepend my knowledge of gdb. It teached me to pay attention and if something looks weird, it probably is weird. I would rate this one the easier side of medium, if not even easy. "

Faculty is a medium-rated Linux machine from Hack The Box. This is one of the most fun boxes I've done in a while, maybe due to the fact that I never got caught in any rabbit hole. Faculty is straight forward and have quiet simple exploits for both user and root.

title: Support - Hack The Box
excerpt: "Support is an easy-rated Windows machine from HackTheBox. Although it's easy rating we'll touch on two major areas - Active Directory and Binary Exploitation/Analysis, making it an very fun and interesing box. Personally I think the box is more towards medium rating rather than easy, but this probably rooted in my incompetence of Windows Active Directory. Throughout the box we'll see tools such as dnSpy, BloodHound, bloodyAD, impacket and more."

title: Carpediem - Hack The Box
excerpt: "Carpediem is a hard-rated Linux machine from Hack The Box and probably one of the best, if not even the best, box I've done. This is a HUGE box with a lot of different containers and feels very real world. We have to pivot left and right, enumerate a lot and probably do 3-4 privilege escalations before we're finally root. Because of the big scope this box took me a few days to complete and I got stuck on several places along the way. The path to user was very fun and even incorporates VoIP as a vector, path to root introduced me to a new docker escape that was amazing - I can't wait to try it out in the real world! If you haven't done this box yet, make sure that you try it out."

Carpediem is a hard-rated Linux machine from Hack The Box and probably one of the best, if not even the best, box I've done. This is a HUGE box with a lot of different containers and feels very real world. We have to pivot left and right, enumerate a lot and probably do 3-4 privilege escalations before we're finally root. Because of the big scope this box took me a few days to complete and I got stuck on several places along the way. The path to user was very fun and even incorporates VoIP as a vector, path to root introduced me to a new docker escape that was amazing - I can't wait to try it out in the real world! If you haven't done this box yet, make sure that you try it out.

title: Vessel - Hack The Box
excerpt: "Vessel is a hard-rated Linux machine from Hack The Box. I really really liked this box, it was straight to the point and not any real rabbit holes. The path to both user and root was easily identified, however getting there took a lot of research and some time spent bashing the head on the keyboard. There are scripting parts needed to complete this box, something that I am not very good at, but it was simple enough for even me to enjoy it. I was introduced to a few new tools and techniques, and learned a lot. This is an amazing box, I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys scripting or would like to learn."

Vessel is a hard-rated Linux machine from Hack The Box. I really really liked this box, it was straight to the point and not any real rabbit holes. The path to both user and root was easily identified, however getting there took a lot of research and some time spent bashing the head on the keyboard. There are scripting parts needed to complete this box, something that I am not very good at, but it was simple enough for even me to enjoy it. I was introduced to a few new tools and techniques, and learned a lot. This is an amazing box, I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys scripting or would like to learn.

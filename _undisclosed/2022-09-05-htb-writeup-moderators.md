title: Moderators - Hack The Box
excerpt: "Moderators is a hard-rated Linux machine from Hack The Box. Doing this box about a month after release it has a very low rating of only 2.6, and honestly I do agree. Throughout this box you'll enumerate, enumerate and then enumerate some more. The few vulnerabilities presented have low quality in terms that you will learn little to nothing. That path to root is unique but sadly more annoying then fun/interesting. I see why the box creator went this way, as it show cases something never seen on Hack The Box - but to be honest, this box has nothing to do with hacking. If you need the points, go ahead and do this box, if not I'd advise you to do something else with your time. "

title: RedPanda - Hack The Box
excerpt: "RedPanda is a very cute easy-rated Linux machine from Hack The Box. I can see why it's rated as easy, but for someone with limited Java experience I found it a bit rough on the root part. But as long as you take it nice and easy, and really make sure to have all your ducks in a row, you will root it without too much headache. Personally I found this box to be quite fun with the short stories about the different red pandas. The box is short box and straight to the point which I also enjoy. In the end I didn't learn anything new, but I definitely refined my code review skills in Java. "

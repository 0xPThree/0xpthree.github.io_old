title: Health - Hack The Box
excerpt: "Health was a easy-rated Linux machine from Hack The Box, that later got bumped to medium. The initial foothold shows you a new unique way of attacking unreachable services that I really appreciate. Im not sure if this approach could be streamlined, but I did it manually which was very time consuming and unintuitive. Looking back I do agree that this should be a medium box rather then easy, but I can see why they set easy rating to start with as there are very few steps if you know what you're doing. Conclusion, I need to deepen my MySQL skills."

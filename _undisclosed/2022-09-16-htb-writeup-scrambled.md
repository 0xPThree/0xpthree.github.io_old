title: Scrambled - Hack The Box
excerpt: "Scrambled is a hard-rated Windows machine from Hack The box, and upon completion I got rank 1 in Sweden! My view on this box is unfairly skewed by the case for rank 1 making this more of a chore then a enjoyable learning experience. Looking back the box is really cool showcasing tickets and their power, something I'm not super comfortable with as I lean more towards Linux rather then Windows. This was a good and educational box going for user, but I feel like the path to root was a bit to simple. I can see how Windows gurus would love this box, so if that's you go ahead and get started! "
